# Asteroid Dodge Game
This project started out as a final assignment for my **AP Computer Science** course. I recently found the source code and decided to put it up on GitHub. The game was created during my junior year of high school. The project remains identical to the original version other than audio being replaced.

The game was created with [Processing for Java](https://processing.org/). Processing is a open-source graphics library useful for rapid prototyping and education.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the [Java 8 Runtime Enviroment](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) if you do not currently have it
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/leskaa/AsteroidDodgeGame/releases/tag/v1.0) of the application from the [releases page](https://github.com/leskaa/AsteroidDodgeGame/releases)
3. Extract the zip into a folder
4. Run AsteroidDodgeGame.exe

## How to Play

* **Avoid Asteroids**

Evade asteroids for as long as possible. A high score table is already populated with symbolic high scores from the game's development. Scoring higher than these scores will causes your time to be added to the table.

* **Utilize Power-Ups**

Power-ups are available to pick up and actiate at any time. They appear on a stack in the top left after collection. You may hold up to four power-ups at once. Activating a power-up causes the most recently collected one to be used.

### Power-Ups

* *Yellow* - Shields ship preventing loss from next collision

* *Blue* - Increases speed of ship for 10 seconds

* *Purple* - Vertical Lazer destroys asteroids north and south of UFO

* *Red* - Horizontal Lazer destroys asteroids east and west of UFO

### Controls

* **Left Arrow** - Rotate UFO counter-clockwise

* **Right Arrow** - Rotate UFO clockwise

* **Up Arrow** - Move in direction of blue UFO panel

* **Space** - Activate most recently collected power-up
